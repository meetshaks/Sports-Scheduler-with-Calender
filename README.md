# Sports Scheduler

Sports Scheduler is a web application designed to manage sports match schedules. It provides an admin interface for creating, updating, and deleting schedules, and a player interface for viewing schedules. The application uses PHP for backend logic, MySQL for data storage, and HTML for the frontend, with a simple and intuitive user interface.

## Features

- **Admin Login**: Secure login for administrators to access the admin panel.
- **Admin Panel**:
  - Add new schedules with date, time, group name, match count, and up to four players.
  - Update or delete existing schedules.
  - View schedules in a calendar format with navigation for previous and next weeks.
  - Validate player availability to prevent scheduling conflicts.
- **Player View**:
  - Displays a list of players and their scheduled matches.
  - Shows a calendar view of schedules with navigation.
  - Highlights recent updates for quick reference.
- **Backend Validation**:
  - Checks for duplicate player selections in a single schedule.
  - Ensures players are not scheduled for multiple matches at the same time.
- **Database**: Uses MySQL to store schedule data, including date, time, group name, match count, players, and timestamps.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Admin login page.
- `player.html`: Player interface for viewing schedules and players.
- `adminpanel.html`: Admin interface for managing schedules.
- `sports_scheduler.sql`: SQL script to create the `schedules` table in the MySQL database.
- `check_schedule.php`: Backend script to validate player availability for a given date and time.
- `login.php`: Handles admin login authentication.
- `schedules.php`: Manages CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for schedules.
- `config.php`: Database connection configuration.

## Prerequisites

- **Web Server**: Apache or any server supporting PHP (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP).
- **PHP**: Version 7.4 or higher.
- **MySQL**: Version 5.7 or higher.
- **Browser**: Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) for accessing the application.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/meetshaks/Sports-Scheduler-with-Calender.git
   cd sports-scheduler
   ```

2. **Set Up the Database**
   - Create a MySQL database named `sports_scheduler`.
   - Import the `sports_scheduler.sql` file to create the `schedules` table:
     ```bash
     mysql -u root -p sports_scheduler < sports_scheduler.sql
     ```
   - Update `config.php` with your MySQL credentials (username and password).

3. **Configure the Web Server**
   - Place the project files in your web server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
   - Ensure the server supports PHP and MySQL.

4. **Start the Server**
   - For XAMPP, start Apache and MySQL from the XAMPP control panel.
   - Alternatively, use a command like:
     ```bash
     php -S localhost:8000
     ```

5. **Access the Application**
   - Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost/sports-scheduler`.
   - Use the admin login credentials (e.g., username: `shakil`, password: `1234`) to access the admin panel.

## Usage

### Admin Panel
1. Log in using the credentials defined in `login.php`.
2. In the admin panel, add a new schedule by selecting a date, time, group name (ASN, SNM, EXE), match count (2â€“5), and up to four players.
3. View, update, or delete existing schedules in the calendar view.
4. Use the "Previous" and "Next" buttons to navigate the calendar.

### Player View
1. Access the player page at `player.html`.
2. View the list of players and check their scheduled matches in the calendar.
3. Recent updates are displayed in a modal for quick reference.

### API Endpoints
- **GET `/schedules.php`**: Retrieve all schedules in JSON format.
- **POST `/schedules.php`**: Create a new schedule.
- **PUT `/schedules.php`**: Update an existing schedule.
- **DELETE `/schedules.php`**: Delete a schedule by ID.
- **POST `/check_schedule.php`**: Validate player availability for a given date and time.
- **POST `/login.php`**: Authenticate admin login.

## Notes
- The login system currently uses hardcoded credentials (`shakil`/`1234` or empty credentials) in `login.php`. For production, implement secure password hashing with `password_verify()`.
- The application assumes a MySQL database. Ensure the database is properly configured in `config.php`.
- The frontend uses basic HTML with implied JavaScript for dynamic interactions (e.g., calendar rendering, form submissions). Additional JavaScript files may be required for full functionality.
- CORS is enabled in `config.php` for cross-origin requests. Adjust for production environments as needed.
